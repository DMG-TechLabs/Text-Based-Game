## Items

* Note

It's a piece of paper. It's wrinckly and its colour turned yellow. The bottom right corner is folded.

* Terminal



* Bed

An ordinary cheap looking metal bed with a really thin matress. It's umcomfortable to sit there for an extended period of time. When you sit on it, it makes a loud piercing noise.

* Door

A really tall metal door. It's surprisingly in a better condition than the rest of the room. It has a few rusty spots here and there but all in all it's fine. It needs a combination to unlock it.

* Safe

A worn-out safe. The paint has faded in some spots. Due to oxidation, the colour turned cooper red. It's locked.

* Board

A regular board made from soft material. There are pins with notes attached to them. 
There are a few free pins too. Who knows? You might need them later.


## Room Description

You look around you. You decide to examine the corner where the terminal is.
There is a table there and a chair. You decide to take a closer look.
The chair looks rusty and the table looks old and dusty. It feels like everything is going to collapse anytime soon. 
You decide to take a step back. In the right corner of the room, there is a safe. It has some rough spots where the colour has "faded" to cooperish red. It's locked. 
Above that, you notice the board. It has a few pins laying around with some old notes attached. All in all, nothing special. 
Then you decide to rest on the bed. It makes a "screeching" sound when you sit. 
All of a sudden, you get a glimpse of something laying on the floor. It's a piece of paper.
You take a closer look. It's actually a note. 

## End of day

Worn-out you deside to call it a day. You are now laying on the bed looking at the ceiling, thinking about today. 
'Am I dreaming? Or is this a sick joke?' you wonder to yourself. Your thoughts start rushing but the exhaustion overtakes you. 
You dozed off hoping this will just be a bad dream. Tommorow is a new day after all...

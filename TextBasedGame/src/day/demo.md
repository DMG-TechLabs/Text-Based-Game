# Day 1

## Cutscene

You wake up in the room. You open the door. It's locked. You are wearing a irremovable bracelet.
You go to the terminal. Someone is talking to you.
Nothing is really revealed.

> After that you start the tutorial

## Day One Mission

"If you want to talk to me again you have to complete these tasks"

`Tutorial`

1. Type help
2. Inspect the note besides the terminal
3. Read the note
4. Collect the note
5. Open your inventory

## Searching the room

`Room #6` contains:

* note
* terminal
* bed
* door
* board
* safe (contains files that hide the door's passcode)

## Sleeping through the day

Prompt to sleep

---

# Day 2

You wake up.

## Day Two Mission

`Hacking games` that will exist throughout the game

### Ideas

* Mastermind (Fallout)
* Maze with timer

Day one mission: `Mastermind`

Concept: After you complete the game you get a passcode that unlocks the safe in the room

After you unlock the safe and search through the files you get the door's passcode.

The moment you unlock and open the door the demo ends

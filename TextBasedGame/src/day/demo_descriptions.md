## Room Description

You look around you. You decide to examine the corner where the terminal is.
There is a table there and a chair. You decide to take a closer look.
The chair looks rusty and the table looks old and dusty. It feels like everything is going to collapse anytime soon. 
You decide to take a step back. You notice the board. It has a few pins laying around. All in all, nothing special. 
Then you decide to rest on the bed. It makes a screeching sound when you sit. 
All of a sudden, you get a glimpse of something laying on the floor. It's a piece of paper.
You take a closer look. It's actually a note.
